## Features

- Reset the URL input and preview.
- Download the APK file for the specified URL.
- Navigate back to the main fragment from the preview fragment.
- Handle web navigation within the preview fragment.
- Provide feedback on invalid URL inputs and confirm app exit.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The primary programming language used for Android development.
- **Android Studio**: The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android development.
- **XML**: Used for designing the user interface layouts.
- **WebView**: A view that displays web pages within the app.
- **ViewPager**: A layout manager that allows users to flip left and right through pages of data.
- **DownloadManager**: A system service that handles long-running HTTP downloads.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   git clone https://github.com/Vishallab/WebLinkToAPK.git

2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and run the app on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage
1. **Enter URL**: On the main fragment, enter the website URL you want to preview.
2. **Generate APK**: Click the "Generate APK" button to load the website in the preview fragment.
3. **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to clear the URL input and reset the preview.
4. **Download APK**: Click the "Download APK" button to download the APK file for the specified URL.
5. **Navigate**: Use the back button to navigate back to the main fragment from the preview fragment.
6. **Exit Confirmation**: If you press the back button twice in quick succession on the main fragment, the app will close.

## Code Structure
- `MainFragment.java`: Handles the URL input and navigation to the preview fragment.
- `PreviewFragment.java`: Handles the WebView for previewing the website and the logic for downloading the APK.
- `BaseActivity.java`: Manages the ViewPager and fragment transactions.

## How It Works
1. **Main Fragment**: Users enter a URL and click the "Generate APK" button. This triggers the WebView in the preview fragment to load the specified URL.
2. **Preview Fragment**: The WebView displays the website. If the URL is invalid or empty, users are prompted to enter a valid URL. The "Reset" button clears the input and hides the WebView. The "Download APK" button initiates a download of the APK file for the specified URL.
3. **Navigation**: The app uses a ViewPager to manage navigation between the main and preview fragments. The back button is overridden to handle navigation logic and exit confirmation.

## Permissions
The app requires the following permissions:
- `INTERNET`: To load web pages in the WebView.
- `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`: To download APK files to the device.
